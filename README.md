**Problem Summary:**

Hiring and onboarding new talent, especially in tech roles, can be a time-consuming and inefficient process for SMEs. Recruiters may struggle to identify best-fit candidates, and new hires often waste days figuring out tools and processes
Goal: Create tools that streamline resume shortlisting, automate aspects of the onboarding experience(e.g., via web apps or chatbots), and help new employees get started faster

**Use Case - HairCare2u (Haircare and Barber Supply Industry)**

Hiring and onboarding new talent, especially for specialized roles, is a time-consuming and inefficient process for SMEs like HairCare2U. As a growing business in the haircare and beauty retail sector, HairCare2U is expanding its digital operations and requires new hires across both technical and non-technical roles. However, the HR team faces two major challenges:
**Recruitment Inefficiency** – HR struggles to identify best-fit candidates from a flood of resumes, many of which are unqualified. For example, a **Product Specialist** must demonstrate strong presentation skills and sales techniques, while a **Data Analyst** must possess technical skills such as SQL, Excel, and data visualization. Without a smart filtering tool, HR spends hours reviewing applications that do not meet the role’s requirements.

**Onboarding Delays** – Once new employees are hired, they often spend several days figuring out tools, policies, and processes on their own. This slows down their ability to contribute and creates unnecessary frustration.
