**Problem and Solution Summary:**

**Problem Statement:**

Hiring and onboarding new talent, especially in tech roles, can be a time-consuming and inefficient process for SMEs. Recruiters may struggle to identify best-fit candidates, and new hires often waste days figuring out tools and processes
Goal: Create tools that streamline resume shortlisting, automate aspects of the onboarding experience(e.g., via web apps or chatbots), and help new employees get started faster

**Use Case - HairCare2u**

Hiring and onboarding new talent, especially for specialized roles, is a time-consuming and inefficient process for SMEs like HairCare2U. As a growing business in the haircare and beauty retail sector, HairCare2U is expanding its digital operations and requires new hires across both technical and non-technical roles. However, the HR team faces **two major challenges**:

**Recruitment Inefficiency** – HR struggles to identify best-fit candidates from a flood of resumes, many of which are unqualified. For example, a **Product Specialist** must demonstrate strong presentation skills and sales techniques, while a **Data Analyst** must possess technical skills such as SQL, Excel, and data visualization. Without a smart filtering tool, HR spends hours reviewing applications that do not meet the role’s requirements.

**Onboarding Delays** – Once new employees are hired, they often spend several days figuring out tools, policies, and processes on their own. This slows down their ability to contribute and creates unnecessary frustration.

**Solution:**

We propose an **AI-driven HR platform** that streamlines hiring and onboarding for SMEs like HairCare2u:

**HR Resume Parsing & Scoring**– Automates resume screening by comparing candidates against job descriptions. HR can see a % score with a clear breakdown of matched skills, missing skills, and relevant experience. This reduces bias, speeds up shortlisting, and helps recruiters make better decisions.


**AI Onboarding Chatbot**- An interactive chatbot + checklist that guides new employees through onboarding. It answers company-specific questions using FAQs from company documentation or generative AI, always specifying its source. It also comes with a built-in onboarding tracker that allows HR to monitor each new hire’s progress. This gives HR full visibility into which tasks (e.g., setting up email, installing tools, reading policies) have been completed, and which are still pending.


**HR Analytics & Reporting Dashboard**

Visualizes recruitment funnel efficiency, application trends, department hiring success, and training completion rates.

Provides actionable insights to optimize HR strategies and improve employee experience.
